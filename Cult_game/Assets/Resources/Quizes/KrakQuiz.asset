  learningText: "The word 'Krak\xF3w' originates from 'Krak,' or 'Krakus' - the fabled
    ruler of the Vistulan tribes. According to various legends (and there are many),
    Krakus founded the city sometime around 700AD, built Wawel Castle, and vanquished
    the menacing Wawel Dragon that lived beneath it. King Krak also allegedly beat
    back the armies of the Roman Empire, and his daughter Wanda (who ruled the city
    after his death) famously fended off the Germans after they invaded in retaliation
    for her refusal to marry a German prince. Though scientific evidence of either
    is otherwise scant, both rulers have prehistoric earthwork burial mounds in the
    districts of Podg\xF3rze (Krakus Mound) and Nowa Huta (Wanda's Mound), respectively.
    Extensive (though incomplete) inter-war excavations of Krakus Mound failed to
    produce the mythical king\u2019s remains, however artefacts dating to the 8th
    century were revealed. Theories vary on the exact age of either mound, but experts
    agree that they are the oldest man-made structures in Krak\xF3w."

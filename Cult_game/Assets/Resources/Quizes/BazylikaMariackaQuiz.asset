  learningText: "Saint Mary's Basilica (Polish: Ko\u015Bci\xF3\u0142 Mariacki) is
    a Brick Gothic church adjacent to the Main Market Square in Krak\xF3w, Poland.
    Built in the 14th century, its foundations date back to the early 13th century
    and serve as one of the best examples of Polish Gothic architecture. Standing
    80 m (262 ft) tall, it is particularly famous for its wooden altarpiece carved
    by Veit Stoss (Wit Stwosz). In 1978 it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site alongside
    the Historic Centre of Krak\xF3w.  On every hour, a trumpet signal\u2014called
    the Hejna\u0142 mariacki\u2014is played from the top of the taller of Saint Mary's
    two towers. The plaintive tune breaks off in mid-stream, to commemorate a famous
    13th century trumpeter who was shot in the throat while sounding the alarm before
    a Mongol attack on the city. The noon-time hejna\u0142 is heard across Poland
    and abroad broadcast live by the Polish national Radio 1 Station.[1] [2]  Saint
    Mary's Basilica also served as an architectural model for many of the churches
    that were built by the Polish diaspora abroad, particularly those like Saint
    Michael's and Saint John Cantius in Chicago, designed in the Polish Cathedral
    style.  The church is familiar to many English-speaking readers from the 1929
    book The Trumpeter of Krakow by Eric P. Kelly."

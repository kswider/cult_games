  learningText: "Wawel is a limestone hill in the centre of Krak\xF3w upon the Vistula
    River with a complex of impressive historical monuments of unique historical
    and artistic values. This extraordinary sanctuary determines the Poles\u2019
    identity, is their national and cultural symbol. Wawel used to be the seat of
    Polish rulers, their necropolis and place where the Polish history took shape.
    Wawel of the Piast dynasty Towering above its vicinity and surrounded by swamps,
    the rock of 228 m above the sea level attracted human groups since the beginning
    of the Palaeolithic period as early as 100,000 years BC. In the 9th century Wawel
    was the centre of the Vistulan tribes\u2019 union. At the end of the 10th century
    Boleslav the Brave captured the Wawel burgh and incorporated the Lesser Poland
    in the Piast state. In 1000 the Krak\xF3w bishopric was established as part of
    the Gniezno archdiocese and the Wawel cathedral building was erected. In the
    1st half of the 11th century the stone pre-Romanesque buildings were erected
    in connection with the ruler\u2019s residence of sacral and secular nature, e.g.
    the four-apse rotunda of St. Felix and St. Adaukt, the baptistery rotunda at
    the cathedral, the \u201Cquadrangular building.\u201D During the reign of Casimir
    the Restorer in the years 1034-1058 Wawel became the main capital of the state.
    The reconstruction of ruler\u2019s residence started a new phase of construction,
    already in the Romanesque style (palace with the two-storey hall, the so-called
    hall of twenty-four pillars with a chapel, the palace basilica of St. Mary of
    Egypt). In the 2nd half of the 12th century Wawel became a burgh of extraordinarily
    high importance with the number of sacral buildings reaching ten and the expanded
    residential complex.  At the turn of the 13th and 14th century the hill was surrounded
    with a stone defensive wall at the site of the previous wooden and earth works.
    Clear division was then established between the upper castle, that is, the royal
    residence (constructed throughout the entire 14th century) and the lower castle
    which provided service and economic facilities. At the initiative of W\u0142adys\u0142aw
    the Elbow-high and with participation of Bishop Nanker the Gothic Cathedral was
    constructed and consecrated in 1364. In the 14th century and the 1st half of
    the 15th century, during the reign of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Jagie\u0142\u0142o,
    the castle fortifications were reconstructed and expanded (towers: Jordanka,
    Z\u0142odziejska, Lubranka, and the Lower Gate defensive complex)."
